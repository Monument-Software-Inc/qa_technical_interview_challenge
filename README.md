## QA Automation Engineer Coding Test

### Test Scenario
With recent trends of people leaving Twitter and joining [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) there is a need to ensure the sign-up process is smooth and flawless. The Mastodon community has asked you to write some automation tests to validate that a new user can create an account, validate their email, sign in and publish the message "I'm now a Mastodonian" to the world.

### Test Cases
Document test cases you are considering, both happy and non-happy path (even if not 100% are covered by automation)

### Test Data
What test data would you define to run the needed scenarios? Are there any dependencies you would need to consider? Please describe your approach.

### Automation Test

Based on your defined approach, create an executable Cypress test. The test should be able to run against the live Mastodon web application. While we are not looking for a comprehensive solution we will assess the following:

1. Ability to understand a feature
2. Ability to identify meaningful test scenarios including edge cases that may not be immediatley obvious
3. Ability to write an automated test covering all identified test scenarios
4. JavaScript and Cypress skills
5. Ability to create an elegant solution
